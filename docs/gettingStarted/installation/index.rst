Installation

.. note::
    We currently do not offer any binaries. Instead, the source code has to be compiled manually. We are working on simplifying the installation of the framework.

Windows using Visual Studio 2019
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Stratega is compiled using CMake. Luckily Visual Studio already provides a simple way to do this. 

#. Install Visual Studio 2019 Community from `here <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`_
#. Clone Stratega from `here <https://github.com/GAIGResearch/Stratega/>`_
#. In Visual Studio open the folder (not project) containing the Stratega source code
#. Execute **Project->Generate Cache**, Visua Studio may automatically do this when opening the folder
#. Execute **Build->Build All** to generate the executables
#. Under **Select Startup Item...** choose GUI.exe and press **F5** to run it
