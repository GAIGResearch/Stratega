	/// Is the driving component of Stratega, with a provided gamestate it can generate a new set of available
	/// actions thanks to the <see cref="SGA::EntityActionSpace"/>.
	/// The returned actions store the action type and a list of sources and targets the action will be applied to.
	/// Each <see cref="SGA::RTSForwardModel"/> and <see cref="SGA::TBSForwardModel"/> by default contains the definition of how to advance the game
	/// and other utilities methods used in each specific game type.
	/// When a player provides the forward model an action and a gamestate, it first checks the type of action
	/// and after it updates the action info before executing the action.
	/// The forward models can be extended by implementing forward model abstractions, can be useful for reducing the games
	/// complexity and ease the training and decision-making process of AI agents.
